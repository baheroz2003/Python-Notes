Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets.
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))
#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))
tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)
tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")
thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thistuple)
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[1])
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[-1])
Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.
Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a built-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items to a tuple.
1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple.
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.append("orange")
thistuple = tuple(y)
2. Add tuple to a tuple. You are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = ("orange",)
thistuple += y
print(thistuple)
Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can use the same workaround as we used for changing and adding tuple items:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.remove("apple")
thistuple = tuple(y)
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
del thistuple
print(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists
